Route::post('/organization/reports/preview', [ReportController::class, 'preview'])->name('organization.reports.preview');
Route::get('/organization/reports/volunteers', [ReportController::class, 'monthlyRecruitedVolunteers'])->name('organization.reports.volunteers');
Route::get('/organization/reports/completed-tasks', [ReportController::class, 'monthlyCompletedTasks'])->name('organization.reports.completed');

Route::get('/organization/reports/comprehensive', [ReportController::class, 'monthlyComprehensiveReport'])->name('organization.reports.comprehensive');
```

## Usage

### 1. Access Reports
1. Login as an organization user
2. Navigate to "Generate Reports" in the sidebar
3. Select desired month, year, and report type
4. Click "Preview" to see data summary or "PDF" to download

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Preview Report Data
```http
POST /organization/reports/preview
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "month": 12,
    "year": 2024,
    "type": "volunteers"
}
```

#### Generate PDF Reports
```http
GET /organization/reports/volunteers?month=12&year=2024&format=pdf
GET /organization/reports/completed-tasks?month=12&year=2024&format=pdf
GET /organization/reports/failed-tasks?month=12&year=2024&format=pdf
GET /organization/reports/comprehensive?month=12&year=2024&format=pdf
```

### 3. Testing with Sample Data
Run the test data seeder to populate sample data:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=ReportTestDataSeeder
```

This creates:
- 1 test organization (org@test.com / password)
- 10 test volunteers (volunteer1@test.com to volunteer10@test.com / password)
- Sample opportunities, applications, tasks, and assignments

## Technical Details

### Database Queries
The module efficiently queries the following relationships:
- `Applications` â†’ `Opportunities` â†’ `Organization`
- `Assignments` â†’ `Tasks` â†’ `Opportunities` â†’ `Organization`
- `Users` â†’ `VolunteerProfiles`

### Performance Considerations
- Uses eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Implements proper indexing on date fields
- Limits preview data for better performance
- Uses efficient groupBy operations for statistics

### Security
- Protected by organization role middleware
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input validation on all parameters
- Organization-scoped data access only

## Customization

### PDF Styling
Modify the PDF templates in `resources/views/organization/reports/pdf/` to customize:
- Colors and branding
- Layout and typography
- Additional data fields
- Statistical calculations

### Report Logic
Extend `ReportService.php` to:
- Add new report types
- Modify data filtering logic
- Include additional statistics
- Change date range calculations

### UI Components
Customize `index.blade.php` to:
- Add new filter options
- Modify preview functionality
- Change report type options
- Update styling and layout

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **PDF Generation Fails**: Ensure DomPDF package is properly installed
2. **No Data in Reports**: Check if organization has completed applications/tasks
3. **Permission Errors**: Verify user has organization role and profile is complete
4. **Styling Issues**: Check CSS compatibility with DomPDF limitations

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode in the controller to see detailed error messages:
```php
$pdf = PDF::loadView('view', $data)->setOptions(['isHtml5ParserEnabled' => true, 'isRemoteEnabled' => true]);
```

## Future Enhancements
- Export to Excel format
- Email report scheduling
- Multi-month date ranges

- Chart and graph integration
- Report templates customization
- Automated report generation
